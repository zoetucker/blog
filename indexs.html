  <p>Let me tell you who I am..</p>
  <p>I am just an ordinary girl growing up in a city in one province in Thailand. I lived in Thailand for all of my whole life and always have a dream becoming a flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't. You know why? That's all because I'm just 5
    feet and 3 inches! Can't reach the overhead cabin. </p>
  <p>However, I still have a dream of going outside of my hometown just once in my life. You know I'm just a curious one. What is going on out there and why people don't speak only English? Why ? What? How? Those are in my head.</p>
  <p>Then one day, it is just like the door of opportunity has opened in front of me! I got so excited to learn about the aupair program and I've set my heart to start my journey to go to America! Guys! America is such a big deal for a rural girl
    like me who never boarded on the airplane and she wanted to go to America! Come on! Well, I fought against all odds and make it possible and boom!I landed in the US in 2012 and have lived here for almost 9 years. And guess what? I got my
    citizenship last year! From the start until now, sometimes I just can't believe that it all happens because of the first time traveling, and it has chaged something in me and my life for the better...</p>
